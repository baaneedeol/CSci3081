  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Task 1 description of the VTS software.</p>
  <p> 
      The VTS software models a vehicle transit system around the University of Minnesota campus.
      It simulates the behavior of buses and trains operating on specific routes, allowing users to visualize the dynamics of transport operations in a controlled environment.
      The VTS software facilities provide an understanding of how vehicles serve transit lines, pick up and drop off passangers, and how passenger demands vary at different stops.
