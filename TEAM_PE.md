# Team Policies and Expectations

## Instructor's Expectations and Responsabilities for All Students

### Project Iteration Responsibilities of the Team (as a Team)
* Together, determine the distribution of work and design this distribution so that it is possible for each team member to contribute a roughly equal effort toward the success of the project. Make your best guess about this at the start of the project, and refine the responsibilities if needed as you go. Consult the instructor if any issues arise or you need clarifications.

#### Distribution of Work
**Step 1: Please, provide here a brief description (one short paragraph) of the distribution of work across your team. You can refine this description as you carry out the project iteration.**
* For Project Iteration 1, we plan on dividing up the three recommended tasks (tasks 1-3, 12) among the team. Daniela will take on task 2, Baanee will take on task 3, and Joey will take on task 12.
* We will collaborate on task 1 as a group. For the remaining tasks, we will continue to assign them based on their content.

### Project Responsibilities of the Individual
* Individually, contribute to the success of the team according to the policies and schedule agreed upon by all team members. Individually, create the opportunity for everyone in your group to succeed at being a good team member - don't do all the work yourself.

## Additional Expectations and Responsabilities Set by The Students
Establish your own additional team policies around the following aspects:

* Expectations for regular group meetings and synchronous class/lab attendance.
* Expectations for frequency, method, and response time for communication on Piazza.
* Expectations for using other forms of electronic communication.
* Expectations for frequency of contributions to the project.
* Expectations on how to communicate when things are not working as we expected.
* Others.

#### Additional Expectations and Responsibilities
**Step 2: Please, describe here (using as much text as you need) additional expections and responsibilities for this project iteration**.
* We plan on meeting at least once a week, and will plan for further meetings based on the workload per iteration.
* Our communication will be through an imessage groupchat, where we will communicate updates/progress as well as meet either in person or virtually on facetime.
* Each person will have at least one task assigned per week.
* When we are experiencing difficulties, we will communicate through our group chat as well as attending office hours to recieve further help.

## Team Member Names
**Step 3: Please enter your name. Each one of the team members should add the name through a different commit. For example, student A adds their name and commits, then student B adds their name and commits.**
* Daniela Ortiz 
* Joseph Vohnoutka
